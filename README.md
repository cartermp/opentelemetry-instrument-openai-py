Project site: https://github.com/cartermp/opentelemetry-instrument-openai-py

## How to use it

Simple! First, install this package.

### Usage

With autoinstrumentation agent:

```
poetry add opentelemetry-instrument-openai
poetry run opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install
poetry run opentelemetry-instrument python your_app.py
```

If you prefer to do it in code, you can do that too:

```python
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from opentelemetry.instrument.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role":"user", "content":"Tell me a joke about opentelemetry"}],
)
```

You can then run your app normally with your own opentelemetry initialization.
