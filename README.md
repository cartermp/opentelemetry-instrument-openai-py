# opentelemetry-instrument-openai

It's OpenTelemetry instrumentation (python) for OpenAI's library.

## How to develop

Get [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Python build and dependency management is fucked but this is about as good as it gets.

Now install and run tests:

```
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```

Now you can develop and run tests as you go!

## How to run the example
